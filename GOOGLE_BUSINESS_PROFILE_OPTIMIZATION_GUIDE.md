---

## CRITICAL: NAP Consistency (Name, Address, Phone)

Your NAP information MUST be identical across ALL platforms. Any discrepancy will hurt your rankings.

### Current Website Information (from fileeasyaccountancy.co.uk):

**Business Name:** File Easy Accountancy (or Fileeasy Accountancy - choose ONE and use consistently)

**Address:**
- Street: 43 Castle Avenue
- City: Rochester
- County: Kent
- Postcode: ME1 2DU
- Country: United Kingdom

**Phone Number:** +44 7894 447435 (or +447894447435 - use consistent formatting)

**Email:** info@fileeasyaccountancy.co.uk

**Website:** https://fileeasyaccountancy.co.uk

**Google Maps CID:** 0x47d8cd14844b6e53:0x4d94bad817be51bb

### Action Items:
- [ ] Verify business name matches exactly on GBP, website header, footer, and all pages
- [ ] Verify address matches exactly (including punctuation, abbreviations)
- [ ] Verify phone number format matches (use same format everywhere)
