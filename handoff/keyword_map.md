1. **Thin meta descriptions** (Carleys has none visible)
2. **Vague H1s** ("Accountable for your success" = poetic but not SEO-clear)
3. **Lack of structured FAQs** on homepages (only Orchard has dedicated FAQ page)
4. **Low review counts** (AK Tax has 13; Fileeasy can leapfrog with proactive GBP review campaign)
5. **Generic "call us" CTAs** (opportunity for specific offers: "Free 30-min tax health check")
