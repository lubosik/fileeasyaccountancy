## 7. FAQs (250–350 words total, 10–12 Q&As, ~25–35 words per answer)

### H2
**"Frequently Asked Questions"**

Use <details> accordion or Radix Accordion component. Each FAQ = <h3> (or data-question for schema).

1. **How much does an accountant cost in Medway?**
   "Fees vary by service. Self-assessment typically starts from £150+VAT, limited company accounts from £600+VAT annually. We'll give you a fixed quote upfront – no hourly billing surprises."

2. **Do I need a chartered accountant for my tax return?**
   "Not required, but chartered (ICAEW/ACCA) or licensed (ATT) accountants offer deeper expertise and professional indemnity insurance. We're [insert credential] and fully insured."

3. **What's the difference between a bookkeeper and an accountant?**
   "Bookkeepers handle day-to-day records (invoices, receipts). Accountants prepare statutory accounts, tax returns, and provide strategic advice. We offer both services."

4. **When do I need to submit my 2024/25 tax return?**
   "Online deadline: 31 January 2026. Paper (if eligible): 31 October 2025. We recommend filing by December to avoid the January rush and any technical glitches."

5. **Can you help with VAT returns and Making Tax Digital (MTD)?**
   "Yes. We handle quarterly VAT returns and MTD compliance using bridging software like Xero or QuickBooks. We'll set you up and file on time."

6. **Do you offer remote services, or do I need to visit your Medway office?**
   "Both. We're happy to meet face-to-face in Medway (Chatham/Rochester area) or work entirely remotely via video call, email, and cloud accounting portals."

7. **What areas do you cover?**
   "We're based in Medway and primarily serve Chatham, Rochester, Gillingham, Strood, and Rainham. We also work with clients across Kent and nationwide remotely."

8. **How can an accountant save me tax?**
   "Through allowable expense claims, dividend vs. salary optimisation, capital allowances, R&D tax credits, pension contributions, and timing of income/expenses. Proactive planning is key."

9. **What is IR35, and does it affect me?**
   "IR35 determines if HMRC considers you an employee for tax purposes, even if you work through a limited company. Affects contractors in IT, consulting, construction. We offer IR35 reviews and status assessments."

10. **How long does a self-assessment tax return take?**
    "With organised records, typically 1–3 hours of our time. If we're also doing your bookkeeping, it's faster. We'll give you a checklist of what we need upfront."

11. **What's included in year-end accounts for a limited company?**
    "Statutory accounts (balance sheet, P&L), director's report, Corporation Tax computation (CT600), and filing with Companies House and HMRC."

12. **Can I claim tax relief on business expenses?**
    "Yes – office costs, travel, equipment, software, professional fees, and more. We'll advise on what's allowable and help you keep compliant records."

**Schema:** Each FAQ feeds into FAQPage JSON-LD (see `handoff/schema/faq_schema.json`).

If you later add legal pages (privacy, etc.), link from footer. No multi-location doorway pages.

## Copy Guardrails

- **UK spelling** throughout (optimise, organised, colour, licence)
- **Plain English** – no "leverage synergies" nonsense
- **Avoid fake claims** – no "award-winning" unless true; no fake reviews
- **E-E-A-T signals** – cite HMRC deadlines, MTD rules with dates
- **Conversational but professional** – "we'll" over "we will," but not overly casual
- **Keyword density** – 1–2% for primary ("accountant Medway"), natural mentions of supporting terms

---

**Next Steps for Cursor:**
1. Migrate existing homepage content to match this IA (consolidate separate service pages into on-page sections if adopting single-page model).
2. Populate FAQ schema from §7.
3. Inject NAP from §9 into footer and schema.
4. Add internal scroll anchors for CTAs.
5. Implement lazy-load for images, defer non-critical JS.

See [execution_phases.md](./execution_phases.md) for phased rollout.
