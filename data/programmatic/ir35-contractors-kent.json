    {
      "q": "What is IR35 and why should contractors in Kent care?",
      "a": "IR35 rules determine whether contractors should pay tax and National Insurance as if they were employees. Getting caught inside IR35 unexpectedly can result in significant additional tax bills and penalties, particularly for high-earning contractors."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I know if my contract is inside or outside IR35?",
      "a": "IR35 status depends on the actual working relationship, not just the contract terms. We assess control, substitution rights, mutuality of obligation, and other factors to determine your status and provide written confirmation."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between public and private sector IR35 rules?",
      "a": "For public sector clients, the client determines IR35 status. For private sector clients (medium/large companies), the client also determines status, but small companies are exempt from off-payroll working rules."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I challenge an inside IR35 determination?",
      "a": "Yes, you can appeal IR35 determinations through the client's appeals process. We help contractors prepare evidence and arguments for appeals, including contract amendments and working practice changes where appropriate."
    },
    {
      "q": "What records should I keep for IR35 compliance?",
      "a": "Maintain detailed records of your working arrangements, contracts, invoices, evidence of control (or lack thereof), substitution rights, and any business expenses. We provide record-keeping templates for contractors."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much does IR35 non-compliance cost?",
      "a": "HMRC can demand additional tax and National Insurance going back up to 6 years, plus penalties of 15-30%. For a contractor earning £80,000, this could mean £15,000+ in additional taxes per year of non-compliance."
