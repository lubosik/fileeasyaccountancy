A sole trader is the simplest business structure - you are the business, with minimal paperwork but personal liability. A limited company is a separate legal entity that protects your personal assets but requires ongoing compliance with Companies House and HMRC.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "Can I switch from sole trader to limited company later?",
      "a": "Yes, you can incorporate your sole trader business at any time. This involves closing your sole trader records with HMRC, transferring assets to the new company, and setting up company systems. We manage the entire transition process, typically taking 2-3 weeks."
    },
    {
      "q": "When should I register for VAT as a sole trader vs limited company?",
      "a": "VAT registration rules are the same for both structures - mandatory at £85,000 turnover in 12 months. However, limited companies often benefit from voluntary VAT registration earlier due to input VAT recovery on setup costs and equipment purchases."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the main tax differences between sole trader and limited company?",
      "a": "Sole traders pay Income Tax (20-45%) and Class 2/4 National Insurance on all profits. Limited companies pay Corporation Tax (19-25%) on profits, then dividend tax (8.75-39.35%) when extracting money. The combined rate is often lower for limited companies, especially above £20,000 profit."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I need separate bank accounts for sole trader vs limited company?",
      "a": "Limited companies legally require separate business bank accounts. Sole traders can technically use personal accounts but we strongly recommend separate business accounts for cleaner bookkeeping and professional credibility."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which structure is better for claiming business expenses?",
      "a": "Both structures can claim legitimate business expenses, but limited companies have more flexibility - they can provide benefits to directors, claim broader travel expenses, and recover VAT on purchases more easily if VAT registered."
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens if my limited company makes a loss?",
      "a": "Limited company losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future profits, reducing Corporation Tax. They can also be used to claim back Corporation Tax paid in the previous year. Sole trader losses offset against other income in the same tax year or carry forward to future years."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much does it cost to run a limited company vs sole trader in Kent?",
      "a": "Sole traders have minimal ongoing costs - mainly tax return preparation (£150-300/year). Limited companies need annual accounts, Corporation Tax returns, and Companies House filings, typically costing £1,200-2,400/year for professional compliance support."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I be employed and run a limited company at the same time?",
      "a": "Yes, you can be employed elsewhere and run a limited company, but check your employment contract for any restrictions. You'll need to manage tax codes carefully and may need to complete Self Assessment if your company income exceeds £1,000 annually."
