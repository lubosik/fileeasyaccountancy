  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "When do I need to register for VAT in the UK?",
      "a": "You must register for VAT if your taxable turnover exceeds £85,000 in any 12-month period, or if you expect it to exceed this threshold in the next 30 days. However, voluntary registration can benefit many businesses below this threshold."
    },
    {
      "q": "Should I choose Flat Rate or Standard VAT scheme?",
      "a": "Flat Rate VAT (16.5% for most services) is simpler but may not always be most cost-effective. We analyse your business expenses and input VAT recovery potential to recommend the best scheme for your situation."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I register for VAT before reaching the threshold?",
      "a": "Yes, voluntary VAT registration is available and often beneficial for businesses that purchase significant materials/services with VAT, sell mainly to VAT-registered businesses, or want to appear more established."
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens if I miss the VAT registration deadline?",
      "a": "Late registration can result in penalties and backdated VAT liability. HMRC may require you to account for VAT from when you should have registered, even if you didn't charge it to customers."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I need an accountant for VAT registration in Kent?",
      "a": "While not mandatory, using a qualified accountant ensures correct scheme selection, compliance from day one, and ongoing support. Our Kent-based service includes registration, setup, and quarterly returns."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long does VAT registration take in the UK?",
      "a": "HMRC typically processes VAT registration within 2-3 weeks of receiving a complete application. We ensure your application is complete and correct to avoid delays or requests for additional information."
